# EasyBuildfile
Easy, basic buildfile that users can develop from. You'll need to provide your own copy of FE8 (U) and rename it to FE8_clean.gba to run this.

We have three different flavours of make hack that we can run here. Full processes both tables and text, textonly processes text and fast does neither. You can use the faster variants when you haven't made any changes to the tables and/or text. Each of these three variants also produces a UPS file at the end.
